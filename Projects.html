        <p>First project after the pool period. We were asked to reproduce a (fictionnal) website,<br>
        following the model we were given on Figma. Website was required to be responsive,<br> 
        exactly like the model and then hosted on GitPages.</p>

        <p>A team project for an actual customer. My part consisted of the whole content of the website itself<br> 
          (excluding the header and footer, as well as the twitch integration and the carousel).<br>
          We worked on a time crunch of about a month, inquiring regular feedback from the customer to ensure<br>
          satisfaction upon delivery.<br>
          The website is now hosted and functionning (with proper SEO, responsivity and accessibility taken in account).</p>

        <p>A personnal project this one. We were asked to develop a website for the entry exams to my class. I chose to mix<br>
          my two passions and made a website about Magic the Gathering; specifically one of my favorite decks. The goal of a<br>
          primer is to allow someone to be able to play the deck just off reading it. The goal of this specific one was also <br>
          to show what i can do, as a newbie in developpment.

        <p>A very fun one! Starting from scratch, we were asked to build a resume generator. Using a form, you enter<br>
          your informations, and they update in real time on a preview aside of the form. Then, you can get a pdf of <br>
          your resume with the press of a button (requiring us to transfer the data to a server from the form, <br>
          secure said data and convert it from HTML to proper content onto a pdf file).</p>
