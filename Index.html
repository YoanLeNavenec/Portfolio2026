    <h1>Quick introduction</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Yoan, also known as Medhyena among my peers! I'm a 1st year student in the Web@cademy cursus of Epitech Moulins. I'm a web developper both in front<br>
    and backend, but as my diploma will lead me to, also a mobile app developper.</p>
    <p>Currently looking for an apprenticeship to begin (and validate!) my 2nd year in my cursus!</p>
    <p>If you're here, I dare to assume you are either another dev or someone even remotely interested in hiring me. This portfolio will be kept up to date<br>
    with the languages i learned and the projects i worked on.</p>
